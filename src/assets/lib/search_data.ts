        '<p>This post offers a 10,000ft view on the NFT issuance landscape, helping creators better acclimate themselves with the tools, players and resources leading the growing movement around scarce digital content.</p>\n<p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2502ca22-7155-49f8-9003-e42ade2deb30.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560" alt="Designed by [Carlos Gomes](https://twitter.com/carlosecgomes) of Forefront."></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The projects covered in this post are the output of my personal exploration and are by no means a canonical source of truth on the ‘best’ platforms that exist today.</em></p>\n<h2 id="what-are-nfts">What are NFTs?</h2>\n<p>NFTs, short for non-fungible tokens, are uniquely distinguishable digital assets. </p>\n<p>Non-fungibility means no two tokens are the same. Whereas a dollar bill has the same value as any other dollar bill (meaning they are fungible), one car has a drastically different value from another (meaning they are non-fungible).</p>\n<p>NFTs frequently represent scarce digital content, and allow for provable ownership (otherwise known as provenance) of media files which have historically been free to reproduce.</p>\n<p>NFTs allow creators to assign scarcity and value to a digital file, including anything from text to images, videos and sound. </p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1347395072933838851?s=20">Tweet</a></p>\n<p>Think of a digital version of the Mona Lisa, where anyone can take a screenshot - but there is only one true owner. This is an NFT.</p>\n<h2 id="nft-issuance">NFT Issuance</h2>\n<p>The process of creating an NFT is not as scary.</p>\n<p>Creators upload files like mp4s, gifs or jpgs to a distributed database like <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> and issue a token that includes that file in its metadata.</p>\n<p>I found this description from the <a href="https://justincone.com/posts/nft-skeptics-guide/">NFT Skeptics Guide</a> particularly accurate as it demystifies the seemingly dodgy world of web3.</p>\n<p>‘Token + Media = Cryptoart’</p>\n<p>The token itself is not cryptoart. The NFT points to something else and says ‘Hey, this thing and I are joined at the hip. We’re inseparable. Think of us as one’ </p>\n<p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f503408e-8428-418a-91db-8ce898492374.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560" alt="Credit to NFT Skeptic Guide for visualization, Carlos for the rebrand"></p>\n<p>Everyone knows how to create a mp4, gif, and jpg, but very few people know how to issue a token on a blockchain.</p>\n<p>This is where issuers - or platforms that help users create (or issue) tokens come into play.</p>\n<h2 id="issuance-landscape">Issuance Landscape</h2>\n<p>There are now nearly 50 different platforms to mint NFTs. That&#39;s a lot.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into a couple key players and identify what makes them unique in NFT conversations happening today.</p>\n<h3 id="superrare">SuperRare</h3>\n<p><a href="https://superrare.co/">SuperRare</a> allows whitelisted creators to issue 1/1 NFTs, exemplifying the name ‘Super Rare’ by leaning on the fact that each and every token is highly exclusive and of the finest quality.</p>\n<p><a href="ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/18159">// GENERATE by fvckrender</a></p>\n<p>Curation on SuperRare is key, as only about 1% of all applicants make their way onto the platform.</p>\n<p>SuperRare places a strong emphasis on the social nature of NFT collecting, allowing users to like posts and share their collection through a username linked to their Ethereum wallet.</p>\n<p>All purchases on SuperRare are made exclusively in ETH.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1349811824082911232?s=20">SuperRare purchase</a></p>\n<h3 id="nifty-gateway">Nifty Gateway</h3>\n<p><a href="https://niftygateway.com/">Nifty Gateway</a> is currently leading in sales volume, largely thanks to its fiat onramps that allow collectors to purchase NFTs with a credit card.</p>\n<p>While Nifty also offers 1/1 pieces, it’s seen the most success from the issuance of editions - or multiple copies of a specific type of NFTs. </p>\n<p>Nifty leverages ‘<a href="https://niftygateway.com/collections/everything">open editions</a>’ or FOMO-induced drops in which an unlimited number of editions can be created for a finite period of time (commonly 5 minutes or less). </p>\n<p>Each open edition is sold at a base price, and after the window closes, no more of that NFT are ever issued. This has led to a vibrant secondary market and the emergence of novel releases including ‘packs’ or NFT drops with different rarities received at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p>Nifty also leans heavily on curation, as only whitelisted creators are able to release NFTs, almost all of which are marketed as ‘drops’ that sell out in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1352774900163829760?s=20">Nifty</a></p>\n<h3 id="rarible">Rarible</h3>\n<p>Not all NFT marketplaces require permission to access.</p>\n<p><a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> allows anyone to quickly and easily issue an NFT, and is underpinned by a governance token - <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rarible">RARI</a> - that gives users the ability to vote on changes to the protocol.</p>\n<p>While Rarible has had to deal with its fair share of growing pains including wash trading and fraud, the principle of allowing anyone to mint an NFT in a matter of seconds provides a fantastic testing ground for those new to the space.</p>\n<p>Just ask Marc Cuban, who minted his first NFT on Rarible earlier this week.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1354498247700709388?s=20">Cuban</a></p>\n<h3 id="zora">Zora</h3>\n<p><a href="https://zora.co/">Zora</a> offers a universal market protocol for media ownership through the standardization of cryptomedia - or NFTs that include both a media and market components.</p>\n<p>zNFTs add an order book directly to the NFT, allowing creators to buy and sell the token directly without having to interface through any of the platforms mentioned above.</p>\n<p>All zNFTs are issued as 1/1’s and indexed as a part of a global registry, meaning no two NFTs can be replicated.</p>\n<p>While still in its infancy, Zora’s push to make NFTs platform agnostic has garnered interest from projects like <a href="https://catalog.works/">Catalog</a> and <a href="https://mirror.xyz/">Mirror</a> - both of which are utilizing Zora for the NFTs being issued on their respective products.</p>\n<h3 id="opensea">OpenSea</h3>\n<p><a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a> is an NFT issuance platform that doubles as the first NFT marketplace - offering a novel home for creators and collectors to access an aggregate view of all their NFTs collected from the various platforms listed above.</p>\n<p>OpenSea allows anyone to create NFTs, either as 1/1s or as editions.</p>\n<p>The marketplace encompasses everything from crypto art to gaming assets and much more, and is long seen as the home for a global secondary market on any and all NFTs that exist today.</p>\n<p>OpenSea accepts a variety of different currencies, giving creators the ability to accept payment in ETH, DAI, USDC or custom social tokens like WHALE, COIN or HUE.</p>\n<h2 id="the-resources">The Resources</h2>\n<p>The most important aspect of NFTs are the creators themselves - specifically with many of them releasing content across multiple marketplaces in various shapes and forms.</p>\n<p>I’ve found the best place to keep up with the top artists to be <a href="https://cryptoart.io/">cryptoart.io</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/richardchen39">Richard Chen</a>, offering a fantastic breakdown of the top sellers across SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, Async Art, and KnownOrigin.</p>\n<p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3318a05-2c51-49e3-9b66-0bb2671dcc57.jpeg?height=1026&width=2314" alt="Credit: cryptoart.io/data.

id="オークション"><strong>オークション</strong></h4>\n<p>主催側は、NFTオークションの開始価格と期間を設定します。そしてオークションで売り出したい自分のNFT（Zora上のNFT）を選ぶと、スマートコントラクトとして展開され、Mirrorの文章内に埋め込むことができます。</p>\n<p>設定した開始価格以上の入札があると、オークションが開始されます。</p>\n<p>例えば、Aliceが開始価格を1ETH、期間を12時間としたオークションを作成したとします。</p>\n<p>そのときの流れは、</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ボブが1ETHの入札をしました。</li>\n<li>12時間のオークションが開始されます。</li>\n<li>最後の15分以内に入札された場合、残り時間は15分にリセットされます。</li>\n<li>新しい入札は、前の入札よりも10％以上高い必要があります。</li>\n<li>オークション終了時に最後に入札したアドレスがNFTを獲得します。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>となります。</p>\n<p>またオークションからの収益は、好きなEthereumアドレス/スマートコントラクトを指定できるため、自動で送ることができます。</p>\n<p>ここで得た収益を、クラウドファンディングの支援者に回したり、後に説明するスプリット機能で複数のアドレスに流すこともできます。</p>\n<p>　</p>\n<h4 id="スプリット"><strong>スプリット</strong></h4>\n<p>このスプリットは、生み出した収益を複数の人に共有する方法で、複数のアドレスに資金を流せるコントラクトになっています。作品を作ったときに協力してくれた人への報酬や、作品からの収益を寄付する方法として使用することができます。</p>\n<p>これらの機能は今後来るべきがきたらぜひ利用したいと思っています。\n　\n　\n<strong>■ Last Week in Crypto</strong></p>\n<p>１．<a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/">Uniswap | Uniswap V3 Mainnet Launch!</a></p>\n<p>Uniswap v3 がローンチしました。また予定では今月末にOptimismのL2対応になっています。Uniswap v3の概要は<a href="https://bspeak.substack.com/p/uniswap-v3-mina-">以前書いています</a>が、流動性提供の際に価格レンジを指定することができます。</p>\n<p>書いている時点でローンチから３日経ちましたが、USDT/USDCのペアを見てみると、提供されている流動性は基本的に0.97ドルから1.03ドルの範囲に収まっています。</p>\n<p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a6ee3fc-fad5-4f19-9d08-6d8ff682997a.jpeg?height=483&width=1190" alt=""></p>\n<p>Uniswap v2 までは、このスパイクしている部分がなく、使われていない部分が多かったことを考えると、v3によって資産効率がよくなることが視覚的によくわかります。</p>\n<p>また他のAMMを比べるには、TVLだけでは他のDeFiプロトコルと単純に比較できず、資産効率（出来高/流動性）という別の見方が必要ともいえます。</p>\n<p>ちなみに流動性提供者それぞれが、市場価格と自分の予想に基づいて価格レンジを指定し、集中流動性プールが作られていく様子は<a href="https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1390587207279382528">@bantgのツイート</a>で見ることができます。</p>\n<p>　</p>\n<h4 id="nft"><strong>NFT</strong></h4>\n<p>流動性提供したポジションは固有になるため、ポジションごとにNFTで表現されていますが、面白いことにNFTごとにオンチェーンで画像が生成されます。</p>\n<p>そしてこの画像は、ポジションの情報によって変わるようになっています。例えば、配色はペアのトークンによって決まり、同じペアだとしてもトークンIDごとに色の分布が異なるため、それぞれがユニークになっています。</p>\n<p>また預けられたときのトークン比率、集中流動性に基づいていて、カーブの形が変わるようになっています。</p>\n<p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/901b62cf-9506-4ef9-9185-3940c15fbf15.jpeg?height=708&width=882" alt=""></p>\n<p> 右下にあるマークは、自分のポジションがどこにあるかによって変わり、✺のようなマークがついていると、レアマークだそうです（トークンIDが増えるとこのレア出る確率が少なくなり、異なるトークンIDが100個生成されれば約10％、10万個で約3％の確率になるそうです）。</p>\n<p>このNFTのグラフィックを生成するスマートコントラクトは、Uniswap v3の中で唯一アップグレード可能なコントラクトになっているため、将来は新しいルールで生成されるNFTに変更できるようにもなっています。実際に、クリエーターが新しいデザインを提案でき、選ばれたものには助成金を与えることも予定されているそうです。</p>\n<p>　\n２．<a

It all starts with <a href="https://zora.co/songcamp/2863">this</a> NFT.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> <strong>A huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/seedclubhq">Seed Club</a> for collecting &quot;The Unlock&quot; NFT and officially <em>unlocking</em> this first Songcamp for everyone!</strong></p>\n<p>The current music industry models condition us to believe certain untruths: that we must amass millions upon millions of streams a month to earn a decent living, that we must be one thing and build one brand identity and not stray from that, that we must spend an exorbitant amount of time and money finding our audience by paying for data that is siloed off by opaque intermediaries — data that is rightfully ours.  </p>\n<p>All this and more adds up to the hamster wheel performance of the music business. </p>\n<p>And the worst part is it cuts creativity off. It sets illusory limits upon the limitless imagination of creative folks. </p>\n<p>We need not earn millions of streams. We need not build one and only one version of ourselves. And we sure as hell do not need to commoditize our music and let it sit frozen on digital shelves that we don’t own. </p>\n<h2 id="music--the-new-internet--💥">Music + The New Internet = 💥</h2>\n<p>There are new avenues emerging that entirely circumvent these old models. They are young and nascent and not fully understood. We aren’t entirely sure how they work yet, or how most people are going to use them. </p>\n<p>But we <em>do</em> know that they allow us to realize a truer value of digital things, which until now has been decided by a handful of centralized organizations. </p>\n<p>So what we must do now is <strong>experiment</strong>. Songcamp is a place to run these experiments. </p>\n<h2 id="experiment-no-1-→-the-unlock">Experiment No. 1 → “The Unlock”</h2>\n<p>Our first experiment is a songwriting camp that doesn’t end when the music is written, but extends out into the visual creation and release of said music. </p>\n<p>The idea is to <strong>collectively fund, create and distribute art</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id="heres-how-it-works">Here’s how it works:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>3 newly-formed groups of <em>music makers</em> are currently co-creating 3 songs from scratch</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>1 team of <em>visual artists</em> is working on cover artwork for those records</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>and a team of <em>project operatives</em> is creating and executing a web3 distribution plan for said music</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where you come in…</p>\n<h2 id="we-are-auctioning-off-a-11-nft-that-unlocks-this-songcamp">We are auctioning off a 1/1 NFT that <em>unlocks</em> this songcamp.</h2>\n<p>Purchasing this piece <em><strong>unlocks</strong></em> this first songwriting camp for all involved. The funds received will go towards a) our distribution costs (gas fees etc.) and b) the visual team that created this artwork. </p>\n<p><a href="ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2863">NFT</a></p>\n<p>This is a 1/1 cassette tape sleeve (known as a J-card) representing the first batch of music created at Songcamp. Artwork is by <a href="https://twitter.com/peace_node">Peace Node</a> + <a href="https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles">Gian Ferrer</a>.</p>\n<h3 id="what-the-collector-gets">What The Collector Gets</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This incredibly dope NFT, a badge of honor that says you unlocked the first songcamp</li>\n<li>Your name (+ logo) included on the final songs’ cover artworks</li>\n<li>Social media love + bragging rights as the named sponsor of this camp</li>\n<li>On-chain recognition as the <em>first</em> supporter of Songcamp, with retroactive benefits (tbd) as the community grows</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="auction-details">Auction Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The auction will close on <strong>Tuesday April 20th at 4pm ET</strong>. </li>\n<li>We’ve decided to bake in a “<em><strong>no resale</strong></em>” mechanic by setting the Creator Equity to 99%. This ensures that the collector is someone who wants to hold this NFT for a lifetime. It also allows us to build an on-chain community of supporters over time — <strong>a community we intend to grow with and bring value to</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>We will be sharing more details in the coming days as to how this music will be distributed. </p>\n<p>We&#39;re excited to go down this journey into the unknown with all of you! </p>\n<p>Oh, do connect with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/songcampdotband">Twitter</a> + <a href="https://discord.gg/wHsJD2sTpc">Discord</a>.</p>\n',

      content:
        '<p>After more than 7 months of checking out the Web3 (crypto) space — reading on how blockchain tech works, and projects being made here and there — I recently minted my first NFT.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Everything mentioned here are my experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. Always remember to check whether the wallet and the platform you&#39;re minting on are on the same blockchain network.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="how-did-i-find-out-about-nfts-web3-and-stuff">How did I find out about NFTs, Web3, and stuff</h3>\n<p>Before I share how I got to mint my first NFT, let me share how the fuck did I get in to this wild world of crypto and Web3.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t recall exactly how, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s because of how <a href="https://twitter.com/rac">RAC</a> — a Grammy-award winning producer — has back-to-back projects happening in the space. I think this was around October 2020, but I&#39;d like to assume I&#39;ve heard of these even earlier.</p>\n<p>From NFTs, the super wild <a href="https://zora.co/rac/tape">$TAPE</a> project — a token representing a physical cassette tape, — to issuing his own social token, <a href="https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac">$RAC</a>, where token holders can have access to a private area in his Discord server, get discounts to merch, or even get to interact with him more.</p>\n<p>I also was introduced to Audius because of one stream he did on Twitch! <a href="https://audius.co/feed">Audius</a> is like Soundcloud, except you (the artist) have a say on what happens to the platform. You want to have a subscription feature? Vote using the tokens given to you every time you post! <strong>The platform&#39;s future is in the artists&#39; hands.</strong></p>\n<p>All these projects were so fascinating to see. With more focus on NFTs, the mere fact that digital artists can make a living out of JUST doing things digitally is amazing to me. No need to print your digital works as stickers, prints, posters, etc. Blockchain technology made it possible for one specific file to be called THE official one. Because of that, all the other copies scattered around the internet, and the ones to be made by saving a copy of the same file, are worthless. <strong>The original file gets value.</strong></p>\n<h3 id="how-i-was-able-to-mint-my-first-nft">How I was able to mint my first NFT</h3>\n<p>Minting (<em>making</em>) an NFT can cost around US$40-$100 in gas (<em>transaction</em>) fees on a good day, and a disgusting $400-$800 on a bad one (although why would you mint during a bad day, lol). Gas fees don’t go to the platform, but rather the people running the whole Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, $40 is already 10+% of what an entry level employee is making monthly, while $100 is like 1/3 of the same salary. <strong>Anyway, bottomline, it&#39;s just so fucking expensive for people here.</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4JE51QwzefMLfknfq/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580" alt="Sees how much I need to mint an NFT"></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://decrypt.co/75463/ethereum-gas-price-drops-lowest-rates-since-march-2020">Gas fees have chilled tf down lately</a>, so minting an NFT is less expensive now. That doesn&#39;t mean that the big price range mentioned won&#39;t be possible again sooner or later, unless <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/">Ethereum 2.0</a> has been released.</em></p>\n<p>I honestly considered saving up for a mint fund, in hopes that I can get my money back and more. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m just here for the money. I&#39;m also here for people to validate that my work has value, maybe even greater than what I would&#39;ve expected.</p>\n<p>Posting on Instagram and Twitter, getting likes for my posts, and I can&#39;t make a living out of it because all the money goes to the platforms?! <strong>I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC AFTER KNOWING ABOUT NFTs.</strong> Did I mention that if your NFT is resold in the secondary market, you get a cut of the resale???!!!</p>\n<p>Then, while I was looking around the Creator x Crypto side of Twitter, I discovered Mint Fund.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/themintfund">Mint Fund</a> is a community project that helps artists in being able to mint their first NFT by giving a grant that&#39;s enough to cover for gas fees. <strong>They prioritize funds to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists especially outside North America and Europe.</strong> They are also working on great projects for the space like making a crowdfund for an open-source protocol.</p>\n<p>I signed up for the grant a week after they launched, but sadly didn&#39;t get in the first batch. It just meant that I was still on the waitlist! I got an email around mid or late April saying that I got in the second batch. GURL, I WAS SHOOKT. I SAW THE EMAIL WHEN I WOKE UP. Now THAT&#39;s how you start a good day!</p>\n<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9ZbWoZgo0leM5G/giphy.gif?height=900&width=1580" alt="Walking out of my bedroom after seeing the email"></p>\n<p><em><strong>Side Note:</strong> For artists in South East Asia, you might also want to apply at <a href="https://twitter.com/firstmintfund">First Mint Fund</a>! It&#39;s another community project giving grants to artists so that they can mint their first NFT.</em></p>\n<h3 id="minting-process">Minting process</h3>\n<p>Y&#39;all... minting an NFT is <em><strong>EASY AS FUUUUUUUCK.</strong></em> Uploaded the file, entered some details, clicked &quot;Proceed&quot;, set up a price, and I&#39;m done. No complicated shit!</p>\n<p>But if you&#39;re starting from nowhere, you should get an Ethereum wallet (like <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>) first, AND WRITE THAT SEED PHRASE DOWN (YES, THE 12 RANDOM WORDS). The seed phrase is like the ultimate password. Lose it, lose everything in your wallet.</p>\n<p>Now with that wallet, you can start connecting it to platforms like Zora, Rarible, Foundation, and more. If the platform is open to the public to mint on it, then go ahead!</p>\n<p>For NFT platforms on the Tezos blockchain, like <em>hic et nunc</em> and Kalamint, I think Temple is one of the most used wallets there.</p>\n<p>Again, EZ SHIT! But I do understand that it can get, or it looks overwhelming. If that&#39;s the case, just shoot me a DM on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/belGIANgwaffles">@belgiangwaffles</a>)! I&#39;ll be happy to help you out. 😊</p>\n<h3 id="and-here-it-is">And here it is...</h3>\n<p><a href="ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3003">NFT</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://gianferrer.mirror.xyz/faYgip4c1BwVbr0UvuVE3Oae2OaKCmlmOxBIgrxFcZc">Read about the concept and what minting an NFT means to me in this post.</a>\n<em>You also might wanna... you know... make a bid or sumn...</em> 🥺👉👈</p>\n<h3 id="zora-as-my-chosen-platform">Zora as my chosen platform</h3>\n<p>I chose <a href="https://zora.co/">Zora</a> as the platform where I&#39;ll mint my first NFT for various reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I feel like it&#39;s not as saturated as other open platforms.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They don&#39;t get a cut from my sale.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I have the option to not have a timed auction being started when somebody bids with my asking price.</p>\n<p>  I just feel like that it hypes the price more than the artwork itself, which I don&#39;t want to be the case.

I&#39;m not asking for money."></p>\n<p>Remember the $RAC token I was talking about earlier? I&#39;m asking for something like that.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s like exchanging a print, postcard, painting, whatever, for access to someone&#39;s Netflix account for a period of time, or live in the buyer&#39;s house for a month. Sure, these things have monetary value, and so does social tokens, but I&#39;m not interested in that.</p>\n<p>My asking price is <strong>60 $FWB</strong> (<a href="https://fwb.help/">Friends with Benefits</a>) which is enough for me to enter the FWB Discord server and apply to be a member (as of writing). The membership, for me, is a way to widen my network especially with fellow creators in the crypto space. I want to get to know more people, see what kind of crazy projects they&#39;re up to, learn from them, exchange ideas, and maybe just chill with them as well. That&#39;s what I wish to get in exchange for my NFT.</p>\n<p>Actually, you can swap your crypto to FWB. My asking price could&#39;ve been the ETH or DAI equivalent of 60 FWB, but I think that&#39;s an easier route. For me, it means way more if someone from FWB sees my work and actually bids on it with their FWB tokens. It&#39;s like a cosign from a member, <strong>legitimizing that I SHOULD be with them.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My second NFT, &quot;<a href="https://zora.co/gianferrer/3328">Shoot Your Shot</a>&quot;, has been sold for 75 FWB Pro.

I want to know how these things work in a member&#39;s perspective, especially if I have a say on the governance of the community or organization.</p>\n<p>THE MONEY SIDE OF CRYPTO IS TOO BORING FOR ME. The People side of crypto is where the fun is all at.</p>\n<p>I already got some $FF by <a href="https://forefront.market/">Forefront</a>.

      content:
        '<p>Over the past few weeks, Berlin-based creative collective <a href="https://www.coquo.co/">CO:QUO</a> has been hosting a virtual panel series titled <a href="https://www.coquo.co/musicfutures"><em>Music Futures &amp; Simulacra</em></a>, exploring the use of “symbols and signs to imagine new futures for the music industry.”</p>\n<p>The first panel, focused on the future of NFTs and crypto for music, took place via Zoom and Facebook Live on June 16, featuring perspectives from artists, researchers, developers and curators. With a healthy dose of skepticism and criticism, the discussion dissected not only how artists can leverage NFTs to gain more ownership over their careers, but also the significant cultural, financial and ethical risks associated with this emerging infrastructure that tend to get overlooked in mainstream music-industry conversations.</p>\n<p>The full recording of the panel is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=451919682566367&amp;ref=watch_permalink">available on Facebook</a>, but we also wanted to publish a text recap of the key themes and takeaways here on Mirror. This specific platform also gives us a chance to put the panel speakers’ collective enthusiasm for collaborative crypto economics into practice, in even a small way.</p>\n<p><strong>This article will be free on Mirror (and the blockchain) forever, but you have the option to support our work and our ideas by tipping us in ETH — and contribute to supporting marginalized voices in crypto in the process.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Using a smart contract known as a <a href="https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw">Split</a>, your tips will automatically be distributed evenly among the following parties (each person/organization gets 10%):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.

Over the course of the next few months, we’ll be publishing deep-dive analyses of music/crypto projects and business models on Water &amp; Music’s Mirror page, experimenting with different options for readers to compensate contributors and/or even earn access to our community Discord server using crypto (through crowdfunds, NFT sale, tips and more).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you enjoy the below recap and/or want to support the people who gave their time and expertise to this panel, any amount in tips would be greatly appreciated. &lt;3</p>\n<p><a href="split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet">CO:QUO panel recap</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This recap is broken down into five themes that emerged from our panel discussion, each representing a different tension, challenge or opportunity in the current state of music and crypto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crypto idealism vs. music-industry pragmatism</li>\n<li>The myth of NFTs’ speculative value</li>\n<li>Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music</li>\n<li>Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives</li>\n<li>Critique and transparency as tools for change</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="crypto-idealism-vs-music-industry-pragmatism">Crypto idealism vs. music-industry pragmatism</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of our panel, moderator and CO:QUO co-head <strong>Kaitlyn Davies</strong> explained the context behind the name of the panel series. The word “simulacra” in particular — which refers to the presence of signs and symbols in place of reality — was <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html">popularized first by sociologist Jean Baudrillard</a> in the 1980s, then <a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation">by the Wachowskis in their renowned film franchise <em>The Matrix</em></a>.</p>\n<p>“Over the last few years, I started to notice signs and symbols replacing all of my realities, which was certainly exacerbated by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic,” said Davies. “But rather than stay with the more dystopian approach that the Wachowskis did with The Matrix, I was more interested in a utopian approach — in building and imagining utopias and new futures, specifically for the music industry.”</p>\n<p>The rapid rise and fall of music NFT hype is a perfect example of people conflating signs and symbols with reality — not just in the literal sense of viewing a JPEG tied to a digital token as equally “authentic” and “real” as the physical world, but also in the metaphorical sense of perpetuating certain myths about how NFTs work and how the artist-fan relationship should look that don’t always line up with the reality of how artists and the music industry operate.</p>\n<p><strong>VÉRITÉ</strong> is an independent artist who has been active in crypto in recent months — most recently selling a portion of master recording royalties for her single “by now” to a fan <a href="https://zora.co/verite/2720">in the form of an NFT</a>. That said, due to current limitations around royalty payments, that revenue split had to be implemented off- rather than on-chain through traditional legal agreements, with the NFT merely acting as an authenticated “purchase receipt” of sorts on top of the song. Other auctions like <a href="https://foundation.app/jacquesgreene/promise-640">Jacques Greene’s “Promise” NFT</a> and <a href="https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/nft-lil-dickys-save-dat-money-publishing-royalties/">Lil Dicky’s “Save Dat Money” NFT</a> had a similar limitation — i.e. auctioning royalty shares through NFTs, but actually implementing those share agreements through traditional music-industry processes that pay out royalties more slowly.</p>\n<p><a href="ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2720">NFT</a></p>\n<p>On this note, during our panel, VÉRITÉ pointed to how two simultaneous conversations were emerging within the music NFT community: “The idealism of what NFTs can be, and the pragmatic and practical reality that we still have to be in relationship with more antiquated systems, especially within the music industry to make that work.” The way in which royalties are collected in particular is a “50-year-old clunky system with a black box that definitely benefits the holders of that black box,” she said.</p>\n<p>A sense of pragmatism needs to be considered not only for issues like fractionalized royalty payments, but also for the realities of fan behavior and how everyday people do (or don’t) value culture.</p>\n<p>First things first: “The masses do not value digital assets,” said VÉRITÉ. “They do not value the MP3. The idea that we’re going to raise the price of a stream beyond 0.004 cents — I don’t believe that is going to happen.” Crypto is also still inaccessible enough such that the vast majority of VÉRITÉ’s fans are not active in that community: “I have probably five fans participating in these things. Until I’m able to issue NFTs with a fiat option and a credit card onboarding ramp, so I can give my fans the experience of owning a digital asset and having them internalize that [experience], they’re not coming over.”</p>\n<p>A related misconception in the crypto world is that there is a critical mass of fans who want to act as financial investors in their favorite artists. <strong>Michail Stangl</strong> — who works at <a href="http://zora.co/">Zora</a> (the protocol that powers Mirror), curates the CTM festival and formerly served as host and lead programmer for Boiler Room — pushed back on this idea that the artist-fan relationship should be financialized in this way by default.</p>\n<p>“A future in which every interaction between audiences and musicians is a financial transaction is dystopian to me,” said Stangl. “A lot of spaces that are designing [crypto] technology assume a certain relationship between fans and artists … if your reality is staring at crypto charts all day, you might think my relationship to my favorite artist is one of an investor. But 99% of fans don’t want to handle cultural investment portfolios, tracking which ‘blockchain track’ is the hottest that might create revenue for them if they sell their fractional share. That is not the way we engage with culture.”</p>\n<p>It will take several years to reverse the widespread devaluation of music consumption, which VÉRITÉ suggested is a necessary side effect of overall “market saturation” in music and the fact that “the creation and distribution of music is now fully democratized.” That said, it’s still common knowledge that fans value music in at least some way, even if it’s not reflected in streaming economics.</p>\n<p>“They are lovers and consumers of art, and they do want to support the artist — we just need new ways to enable them to give that support,” said VÉRITÉ. “We can add these additional value layers, whether that’s membership to a community, or providing people with an experience that’s bigger than just clicking on something and listening to it.” In this process of devising new means of artist-fan support, this is where it’s important to “center voices who have a pure idealism about what we can build.”</p>\n<h2 id="the-myth-of-nfts-speculative-value">The myth of NFTs’ speculative value</h2>\n<p>Independent artist <strong>Zola Jesus</strong> was one of the more critical voices in our discussion when it came to the current state of crypto in music. In a <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/">previous interview with <em>Pitchfork</em></a>, she had expressed her frustration with the financialization of music NFTs, arguing that the market would only become fair for artists once “the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses, rather than what profit it could yield in the future. I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”</p>\n<p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/">Pitchfork</a></p>\n<p>During our panel, Zola Jesus expressed similar sentiments. Initially, she said, her impression of NFTs was positive; she had viewed the technology as an antidote for the corporatization of the music industry — particularly for the “disillusionment” she’d experienced while having to navigate “endless corporate structures,” forcing her to “play a game outside of music itself … [Crypto] was a whole new way to create art, and to be able to find homes and support for that art.” </p>\n<p>However, she quickly became suspicious of the intentions of the buyers of her art, and concerned that her art was just becoming “a means of profiting off speculation.” Rather than representing any real challenge or alternative to mainstream culture, she felt that NFTs in their most hyped-up, auctioned form were simply “further enmeshing us in financial contracts and capitalist frameworks,” with artists being “traded like stocks.” </p>\n<p><strong>Chloe Alexandra Thompson</strong>, who is First Nations (Cree), drew a deeper historical connection between the “cash-grab, transactional rhetoric” around NFTs and “movements around resource extraction and the emergence of new physical colonies on Indigenous land, like mineral mining” (an analogy that is especially relevant given the environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains). The end result is an environment where art is merely being “objectified,” rather than “supported and engaged with in a caring way.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the speculative value of NFTs is largely a myth, anyway. For one, the five- to seven-figure auction model has largely fallen out of fashion for music NFTs. According to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290">research spearheaded by Water &amp; Music</a>, monthly music NFT sales plummeted by 80% from April to May, and is projected to plummet by another 60% to 70% month-over-month in June. Moreover, according to an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00647.pdf">economics paper</a> published by researchers across the U.S. and Europe, under 10% of NFTs that generated a primary sale since 2017 ended up generating a secondary sale within a week, and only 22% generated a secondary sale within a year.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/music-nft-and-2m-46187290">Music NFT and social token database</a></p>\n<p>Artist and researcher <strong>Mat Dryhurst</strong> suggested that mainstream media incentives had a lot to do with NFTs’ rise and subsequent fall. In search of sensationalist news, mainstream media outlets automatically navigated towards the six- to eight-figure sales coming out from only a small handful of platforms and actors in the NFT market, even if those outlets had only a rudimentary understanding of how NFTs actually worked. At one point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive">even SNL got on board</a>.</p>\n<p>“Even in a decentralized ecosystem, you don’t get to decide when people choose to pay attention to things,” he said. “Now, everyone associates ‘web3’ with ridiculous valuations for things that are quite clearly entangled in some dodgy stuff.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest example of this dodginess that seems to have gone over many people’s heads is that the buyer of Beeple’s <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">$69 million NFT on Christie’s</a> — Vignesh Sundaresan, a.k.a. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html">MetaKovan</a> — had a clear conflict of interest. Sundaresan himself is working on his own NFT platform called <a href="https://www.metapurse.fund/">Metapurse</a>, which offers fractionalized investment opportunities in bundles of NFT artworks. The company makes “B20 tokens” available for fans and investors to purchase and trade themselves to represent a stake in the fund. The kicker: Metapurse gave Beeple 2% of B20’s entire token supply shortly before purchasing the artist’s record-breaking NFT. As Ben Davis <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/beeple-buyers-metakovan-twobadour-1953418">wrote for <em>Artnet</em></a>, “This means that Beeple essentially owns 2 percent of the fund that purchased his work at auction.” Of course, the value of the B20 token then went up 13x in the days following the Christie’s sale.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/07/buyer-of-69-million-dollar-beeple-art-metakovan-on-nfts.html">CNBC</a></p>\n<p>“Someone will drop like $30 million on an NFT, which of course sounds like an insane amount of money — but then when you follow the price of the token that they own, a billion dollars in value gets added to the company,” said Dryhurst. “That’s a marketing campaign. It’s what marketing is: You invest money in order to get returns later. Of course, the media loves these kinds of big-ticket narratives, and bought into it — meanwhile, protocols like Zora and many others are quietly building something which is at odds with that mentality and those objectives.”</p>\n<p>This media miscommunication probably led a lot of investors to lose their money on NFT sales, creating a general disillusionment in the market that led to a 90% dip in month-over-month sales in May. Once again, though, the media was incentivized to cover the downfall of the hype that they themselves created. “I think there’s been a bit of a sabotage campaign between the highly coordinated actors pushing for a very specific vision of how [NFTs] work, and a media that is very, very thirsty to write about bad news,” said Dryhurst.</p>\n<p>Stangl agreed, elaborating that the notion of NFTs as “provenance” or as artificially scarce digital collectibles is “only half the story.” Instead, in Zora’s case, Stangl explained that the protocol is even more about redefining and redistributing value than merely about capturing more of it. “Our goal is build an open-source infrastructure that allows anyone to use NFTs to make two fundamental decisions: A, what has value — it can be monetary or something more abstract, social and participatory — and B, how do you distribute that value?” said Stangl. “That allows you to create a matrix where anything from maximizing your personal wealth and selling your asset at the highest value possible, to new models of collective co-creation and redistribution, are possible.”</p>\n<p>This brings us to the next section… </p>\n<h2 id="reconciling-the-tension-between-the-highly-individualized-libertarian-origins-of-crypto-and-more-collective-practices-in-music">Reconciling the tension between the highly individualized, libertarian origins of crypto and more collective practices in music</h2>\n<p>One major gap in a lot of music-industry conversations about crypto, Web3 and smart contracts is that these technologies aren’t just about creating new ways to sell more stuff. At scale, they’re about creating entirely new ways of governing and constituting societies. (Light stuff, we know.)</p>\n<p>“You’re moving on a constitutional level, where you provide rule sets on how one should constitute oneself, in a social system that is utilizing smart contracts to constitute, govern and process itself,” said Stangl. “The question then is, what do you center in terms of your definition of societies? That is the really exciting thing — ultimately what you are creating are blueprints.”</p>\n<p>The crypto platforms that have gotten the most mainstream media coverage to date tend to center a more libertarian view of sovereignty, self-ownership and individual autonomy as opposed to collective action. Cherie mentioned <a href="https://bitclout.com/">BitClout</a> as one of the most extreme versions of this philosophy in practice, where someone’s individual value is investable, tradable and entirely tethered to their social clout — an extension of the individualism rampant in influencer and “creator” culture.</p>\n<p>Importantly, though, the whole point of decentralization is <em>not</em> to ask people to conform to a singular view of society. “If you look at societies that center solidarity or neutrality in the way that they constitute themselves … you can now put those principles into a smart contract and make it part of the blueprint,” said Stangl. “It’s not just a box that you tick at checkout, like, ‘here’s your 1 euro of solidarity if you want it.’ It can be part of the deeper technological blueprint, so that anything you do in the system is rooted in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>A big source of current music/crypto tensions, then, is what Stangl calls “a cultural clash, where a lot of crypto and blockchain is coming from a particular sociodemographic group with a particular view on how society works” (read: libertarianism). This is arguably in conflict with the more collective ways in which many artist and fan communities organize and interact with each other — a conflict that the artists clearly voiced during our panel.</p>\n<p>Zola Jesus was particularly critical of crypto models that seemed to wring creative control and authority away from artists. “That’s something I don’t want to feel like I have to negotiate with my fans … like they have some sort of authority over what music I make or what direction I take as an artist,” she said. “I guess I’m a little more punk in that way, where I don’t want to feel that level of financial tether to a fan base. I don’t want to just become a stock, or feel like I’m getting further embedded into a financial structure that is going to only limit or suppress wherever I want to take my art and my passion. That’s been my biggest concern.” Zola Jesus does have an <a href="https://www.patreon.com/zolajesus">active Patreon page</a> with around 700 members, but she said that that experience has made her feel more protected from the isolation and the “sea of competition and market performance in the music industry … I feel supported in a way that breeds charity, compassion and breeds community.”</p>\n<p>Thompson was similarly interested in an implementation of crypto that better reflected the collaboration and interdependence of creative communities. “What I’m more interested in around 3.0 and decentralization is not so much this replication of, ‘I’m a popular artist or I’m getting discovered in the crypto community, thus I get much money,’” said Thompson. “It’s about how we can collectivize and create independent agencies which allow for group safety and redistribution of resources — thinking about the past record-label model not in the problematic way where artists have been excluded … but how advances were made at varying tiers of people’s careers to help bring them up and support their practice, and how that supports mixing engineers, producers and all these different people who are part of making work.”</p>\n<p>VÉRITÉ more openly acknowledged the notion that, yes, her fans are investing multiple kinds of resources into her work and community “all the time — whether it’s listening to my music, coming to my tour, buying my merch,” she said. Hence, crypto at large could be a valuable tool for her to “give fans an incentive to participate and become a meaningful part of the community, and raise the community’s overall value. And then it’s actually really easy to weed out bad actors, because if you’re just buying my NFT as a speculative thing, you’re probably not going to contribute value into the fan community because that takes a lot of heart, time and effort.”</p>\n<p>The point, though, is that the value of the community is self-sustaining, and is something that exists beyond just the individual artist — which VÉRITÉ suggested could act as a safeguard from the kind of mercenary profiteering that artists like Zola Jesus understandably have reservations about. “My Discord server exists without me,” said VÉRITÉ. “I’ve built a community of people who like to hang out and can entertain themselves while I go away for a month. That becomes the goal, where the community isn’t fully dependent on me as this pillar and this center, but where you’re building something that has a greater meaning than just yourself.”</p>\n<h2 id="letting-artists-control-not-only-the-flow-of-money-but-also-the-incentives">Letting artists control not only the flow of money, but also the incentives</h2>\n<p>Moving a bit beyond just NFTs, much of the panel discussion focused on the value of protocols and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) at large for giving artists the control and ownership they’ve been demanding from centralized platforms for decades.</p>\n<p>“Spotify and Instagram were designed with one thing in mind: To profit the bottom lines of the people who designed them,” said Stangl. “All of the functions and business outcomes were in essence predefined, to benefit those who designed the systems.” (Investor Li Jin posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657">lengthy Twitter thread</a> this week with the same argument: “Without ownership … Creators, by working, are strengthening platform owners’ domination over their ability to work.”)</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657">Li Jin</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, one of the main reasons big-ticket NFT auctions seem like the “only” outcome of the NFT ecosystem is because a small handful of platforms have largely been responsible for driving the now-mainstream media narratives. “We have to give artists the tools to make those design decisions in an informed way, and then benefit from the outcome of those decisions,” said Stangl. “A lot of these things don’t need mitigation or third parties that inject themselves into a particular revenue stream. They can still participate, of course, and still create a value proposition, but that value cannot be justified just by injecting yourself into the part where money passes from one hand to another.”</p>\n<p>One such way to give artists control over their own platforms is through protocols that allow them to code their own economics into their creative works. For instance, Bas Grasmayer <a href="https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/">wrote last year</a> about how companies like Audius are trying to let artists use smart contracts to set their own per-stream rates for consumption of their music online. Protocols like Zora — and the platforms that run on them, like Mirror and <a href="https://beta.catalog.works/">Catalog</a> — give artists the ability to bring in multiple collaborators to share revenue on a given creative work, or even <a href="https://dev.mirror.xyz/TFHT6a9tqa_NxGbatyEf4DhMybjpUabWmUi7nQo4Nfw">wire funds instantaneously to public goods</a>. During our panel, Cherie mentioned that this could lead to a greater diversity of artists getting rewarded for their work — instead of merely “incentivizing repeat consumption” as the dominant DSPs do, which arguably gives an advantage to pop artists while disadvantaging artists who work in less “bingeable” modes like classical, jazz or experimental music.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.musicxtechxfuture.com/2020/12/01/music-streaming-as-a-protocol-why-i-was-wrong-about-audius/">Music X</a></p>\n<p>Music- and creator-focused DAOs like the <a href="https://stoi.org/">Song That Owns Itself (STOI)</a>, <a href="https://seedclub.xyz/">Seed Club</a> and <a href="https://foundation.app/blog/herstorydao-manifesto">herstoryDAO</a> are also becoming increasingly popular for aligning incentives among artists, creative collaborators, fans and industry partners, financially or otherwise. On our panel, Zola Jesus questioned whether DAOs are in any way different from a corporation; Dryhurst offered that the main difference was that “you could see the smart contract as the CEO,” and that “there’s nothing inherent in DAO tools that forces you to see them as a financial vehicle.” (That said, Wyoming recently <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wyoming-dao-llc-law-passed">passed legislation</a> that would allow DAOs to register themselves as LLCs.)</p>\n<p>Stangl emphasized that the appeal of DAOs for underground music communities might be less about financial gain outright, and more about facilitating and managing already-blurred relationships and responsibilities among members. “In the value creation of underground music cultures, the distinction between who is the consumer, vs. who is the artist or marketing person, is often very blurred,” said Stangl. “When you talk about event promotion, in 99% of the cases, that promoter is not a promoter — they’re someone who’s so engaged with the music community that they put their own money into populating the culture … We negotiate that all the time in terms of what audiences contribute, what festivals contribute, what cultural institutions contribute — it’s not as clear-cut as it is in the mainstream music industry.” DAO infrastructure can allow these grassroots communities to “renegotiate those power relationships” with fans and audiences in a transparent and open way.</p>\n<h2 id="critique-and-transparency-are-tools-for-change">Critique and transparency are tools for change</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, an important theme in our panel discussion was that the critique around music NFTs should not be interpreted as an excuse to shut down the system for good. Rather, voicing concerns at such a formative stage of this technology’s development will allow active stakeholders to shape the role they want it to play within culture and society in the long term. In Thompson’s words: “We’ve seen so much critique of these NFT platforms … and I want to make clear that I think critique is a form of care.”</p>\n<p>Davies added that, in an ironic way, the rapid-fire media frenzy around NFTs is also leading to productive conversations more quickly compared to other kinds of technology in recent music history. “It took 10 years for the mainstream to be critical of Spotify, but it took three months for the mainstream to be critical of NFTs,” said Davies. “This criticism is good because it’s getting things more out in the open.”</p>\n<p>Dryhurst added that the core reason why so many people have become so critical of music NFTs so quickly is also because of the technology&#39;s greatest selling point: Transparency.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think crypto alone is creating financialization around culture,” said Dryhurst. “I think crypto is putting that on-chain, and making it all visible, guts and all … And one of the pros and cons of decentralization is that there is no ‘one thing’ in this space. If someone is interested in web3, the good news is that there is no central actor telling you how to interact with it. The bad news is that there’s no central actor to impede somebody else from doing something you don’t like. That’s the kind of bargain you enter into when participating in crypto.”</p>\n<p>Many crypto community members and researchers are already wielding this transparency for more productive use, in terms of better understanding the power dynamics and economics around NFTs, social tokens, DAOs and other applications of the technology. It’s only because of this transparency, for instance, that we’ve been able to pin down that monthly music NFT sales are down by 80%; that figure is practically impossible to pin down in any other sector of the music business, due to data silos across multiple centralized platforms and companies. Others have also published helpful graphics visualizing <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348">token distribution for various blockchains</a>, exposing the blockchains that contradict themselves by having mostly centralized ownership (i.e. majority-owned only by the founders and/or investors).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this transparency can be a &quot;net positive&quot; in that &quot;we might be able to develop some fluency as to how culture is currently working and is currently traded, and how most people see culture as a vehicle for social capital or even capital-C Capital,” said Dryhurst. “And then from there: What are the protocols that we as an individual, community, label, magazine — what do we want to put in place now? That, to me, is a net positive.” ✯</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>ICYMI: If you enjoyed the above recap and want to support its contributors, you can send tips in ETH that will be evenly distributed among CO:QUO, all the panel speakers, the co-authors of this article and two organizations dedicated to helping marginalized artists navigate the crypto world, namely The Mint Fund and herstoryDAO.</em></p>\n<p><a href="split://0x9B30a3D0a6577059eBE1f5D674Ecf34FCb0716CA?network=mainnet">CO:QUO panel recap</a></p>\n',

        '<h2 id="a-step-by-step-guide-to-minting-nfts-for-beginners">A step-by-step guide to minting NFTs for beginners</h2>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7ztnLWcdbBPwGlwDDcIgRw.png" alt="Source: Ethereum.org"></p>\n<p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are the new wave in the cryptocurrency space. Over the last few months, they have opened up new channels for digital creators to monetize their work.</p>\n<p>An NFT is basically a record of a unique item on the blockchain. You can make an NFT for anything; art, music, memes, even a selfie. NFTs can be sold and traded by people all over the world, and their sale recorded on the blockchain. While these digital items can be copied and used by other people on the internet, the appeal of owning an NFT is that there remains a permanent record on the blockchain of the creator of the art, its current owner and the chain of ownership.</p>\n<p>Whether or not you think this is a bubble, the technology and its potential use cases are very promising. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the ability to prove ownership i.e. provenance of digital assets is critical for ensuring that creators can earn and be recognized for their work. NFTs enable this to happen in a way that is borderless and permissionless; a creator in Nigeria can sell her work for millions of dollars to a pseudonymous stranger across the world without a middleman. They also present interesting new ways for people to collaborate on and use digital assets.</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of interest in this space, but also a lot of confusion as people don’t know where to start. This article is specifically for digital artists who have already examined the pros and cons and have decided that they would like to create an NFT and sell their art on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>In this article, I detail the steps you need to follow to create an NFT as a digital artist in Nigeria even if you don’t own or have never used crypto. I’ve also added screenshots so you can follow along.</p>\n<p>If you’re totally new to NFTs, <a href="https://t.co/EmXMMcsGek?amp=1">here’s a good primer</a> about what they are and why they’re important.</p>\n<p>Let’s get to it!</p>\n<h2 id="step-1-create-your-art">Step 1: Create your art</h2>\n<p>Do what you do best and create amazing art. Feel free to play with different forms of digital media and themes — 3D illustrations, audio, abstract, hyperrealistic, whimsical, political — all kinds of works sell as NFTs. <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Beeple’s The First 5000 Everydays</a>, <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804">CryptoPunk 7804</a> and <a href="https://edm.com/gear-tech/3lau-record-breaking-nft-sale">3LAU’s NFT album</a> are three of the current best selling NFTs and they are all very different. Let your creativity run wild, you’re the expert here.</p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*m51GsWRm74lyZL5PUdWDZg.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>“CryptoPunk 7804” was recently sold for 4,200 ETH (~ $7.8m)</p>\n<h2 id="step-2-buy-ether">Step 2: Buy Ether</h2>\n<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth/">Ether</a> (or ETH) is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. At the moment, most of the NFT action is happening on Ethereum so in this article, when I mention blockchain, I’m referring to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>When you mint your art as an NFT, you’re essentially creating a record on the blockchain about that piece of art. The record will show you (your wallet address) as the creator and owner of this work. This record cannot be changed or erased. Even as your art gets sold (and resold), there will always be this initial record of you as the creator and initial owner of the NFT as well as accurate records of everyone who has ever owned it. This record is publicly accessible and everyone can see it on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>To create this record (called a transaction), you need to pay fees known as <em>gas</em>. The gas fees fluctuate based on the level of demand for transactions to be created on the blockchain. At the time of this article, the gas fee for minting NFTs is about $70.</p>\n<p>So, before attempting to mint your NFT, you’ll need to buy some ETH to pay as gas. You can buy ETH with Naira from any local cryptocurrency exchange, I recommend <a href="http://www.buycoins.africa/">BuyCoins</a> :)</p>\n<p>As with all cryptocurrencies, you can buy ETH in small bits. On BuyCoins, you can buy as little as 0.005 ETH (which is currently worth about N4,500 or $9). <a href="http://help.buycoins.africa/article/gbyeu5ko1e-how-to-buy-on-buycoins">Here’s a guide on buying ETH from BuyCoins with Naira.</a></p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rQZD9UnOEiq-PxvQJOo2WQ.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>Buy Ether on BuyCoins</p>\n<h2 id="step-3-set-up-your-non-custodial-ethereum-wallet"><strong>Step 3: Set up your non-custodial Ethereum wallet</strong></h2>\n<p>To connect to NFT marketplaces to mint and sell your work, you need a non-custodial wallet. A non-custodial wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet (an account for storing and transacting crypto) that gives you total control of your funds. This is different from the type of wallet that is owned and managed by a centralized crypto exchange (e.g BuyCoins) on your behalf; a custodial wallet.</p>\n<p>With a non-custodial wallet, you have access to the* seed phrase*, a random 12-word combination that enables you to back up your wallet and access it on multiple devices or platforms. This means that no exchange can block or restrict access to your funds.</p>\n<p>This level of freedom comes with a huge responsibility. If you lose your seed phrase, you’ll also lose access to your funds and won’t be able to recover them.</p>\n<p>There are numerous non-custodial wallets that can be used on mobile or the web. On mobile, there’s Coinbase Wallet (Not to be confused with the Coinbase App) and Rainbow. If you’re using a laptop, you’ll need to get a non-custodial wallet like Metamask or TrustWallet that is compatible with web browsers.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’m demonstrating with Metamask.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting up Metamask</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit <a href="http://www.metamask.io/">www.metamask.io</a> and install the chrome extension.</li>\n<li>Click “Create a Wallet”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vQNey7QUFgFWUGZfoEQ2tA.png" alt=""></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the next set of prompts to create a password (this is not your seed phrase).</li>\n<li>Next, copy your seed phrase — <strong>keep it somewhere safe and memorable</strong>. Like I mentioned earlier, if you lose your seed phrase, you’ll lose access to your crypto. Metamask (or your preferred non-custodial wallet) cannot recover it for you. Anyone who has access to your seed phrase can send crypto out of your wallet, so you need to ensure that no one else can access it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzINDit7VGcuFk8rsQUIgw.png" alt=""></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click “Next” and complete the setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="step-4-move-ether-to-your-non-custodial-wallet">Step 4: Move Ether to your non-custodial wallet</h2>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to move your Ether from the wallet on BuyCoins to the non-custodial wallet that you set up in the previous step.</p>\n<p>For this, you need to get your wallet address. Your wallet address is basically like your account number. In this case, it allows you to receive and send crypto from one wallet to another. On your Metamask wallet, you can copy your wallet address from the top of the page.</p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iWOlbycwgkQM3KhDV0XVEg.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>Copy your wallet address</p>\n<p>On BuyCoins (or your crypto exchange wallet), send the value of the ETH you’ve bought to the wallet address. <a href="http://help.buycoins.africa/article/5shnmmtevz-example">Here’s a guide to sending ETH on BuyCoins</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4UNAVoV7MFZfNH7IirtWw.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>When the ETH arrives in your Metamask wallet, you’ll see that your balance is updated.</p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RWt2BHKp-UiVAK_zUNAbHQ.png" alt=""></p>\n<h2 id="step-5-choose-a-platform-to-mint-your-nft-on">Step 5: Choose a platform to mint your NFT on</h2>\n<p>The choice of the platform is dependent on a lot of different factors. So far I’ve tried minting on Rarible and OpenSea. They are both relatively easy to use.</p>\n<p>I prefer OpenSea because, unlike other platforms, you <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-collection-manager/">don’t have to pay minting fees every time</a> you create a new NFT. You only need to pay the first time, when you set up your collection. For subsequent NFTs, the gas fees will be paid by the buyer of your work.</p>\n<p>Once you mint your NFT, it is stored in your wallet and you can sell it on any platform. So, if you mint on OpenSea and then connect your wallet to Rarible, you’ll be able to sell there as well.</p>\n<h2 id="step-6-create-your-nft-on-the-platform"><strong>Step 6: Create your NFT on the platform</strong></h2>\n<p>This is surprisingly the easiest part. Most of the platforms have greatly simplified the process, so you can create your NFT in just a few clicks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit <a href="http://www.opensea.io/">www.opensea.io</a> and click “Create”. You’ll get a prompt to sign in to your Metamask wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NWbbD0SP-9IEVLfxwcz11Q.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>Viola!</p>\n<h2 id="step-7-list-the-art-for-sale">Step 7: List the Art for Sale</h2>\n<p>Set your preferred sell method. You can either set a price, put it up for auction or bundle it with your other NFTs to sell. For the “Price” option, you can set the price in ETH, DAI or USDC. DAI and USDC are dollar stablecoins — cryptocurrencies whose value is always the same as a dollar. <em>Basically, 1 USDC = 1 USD and 1 DAI = 1 USD.</em></p>\n<p>You can set the price in ETH and select the “Highest Bid” option to ensure that your art is sold to the highest bidder.</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll get a prompt to confirm the transaction and will need to pay the quoted amount as gas fees to continue. Once you click confirm, it will be deducted from your Metamask wallet and OpenSea will list your art as an NFT.</p>\n<h2 id="step-8-set-your-royalties-on-secondary-sales-optional">Step 8: Set your royalties on Secondary Sales (Optional)</h2>\n<p>Unlike other forms of digital art, you can make money from secondary sales of your art in perpetuity. Basically, you can set a percentage that comes to you every time your art is resold. On OpenSea, you set this percentage on the collection.</p>\n<p>To do this, click on the “Edit” button beside your collection and scroll down. Set a percentage as your commission and save your settings.</p>\n<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*b6er1ayPEt-6Gqoe7hlQeQ.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>Set your commission on secondary sales</p>\n<p>…And you’re done. You’ve minted your first NFT on the blockchain. Now to the fun part; share it with other people and discover the endless possibilities of creating on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>If you found this helpful, remember to share it with others.
